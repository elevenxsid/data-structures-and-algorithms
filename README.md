## 📌 About This Repository

This repository is created to track my **Data Structures and Algorithms learning journey** using Python.

At the moment, this repository is in its **initial setup phase**.  
Problems and solutions will be added incrementally as I practice and learn.

The focus is on:
- Building strong DSA fundamentals
- Writing clean and understandable Python code
- Developing interview-ready problem-solving skills
- Maintaining consistency over time
